    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals & Subtle Teal -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as a "Vibe-First Interactive Planner." The user is immediately presented with broad "vibe" categories (e.g., "Live Music," "Chill & Conversation"). Clicking a vibe filters a grid of activity cards below. This is more intuitive for planning a night out than a linear report. Clicking a card opens a modal with details, keeping the user on one page. An interactive chart allows for quantitative comparison of venues (by cost/hours), and practical tips are tucked into an accordion. This structure transforms the report from a static document into a user-driven planning tool, prioritizing task-based navigation (finding the right spot) over a passive reading experience. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report info is broken into JS objects. Goal: Guide Exploration -> Method: Interactive Vibe Filters (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Click to filter a grid of cards -> Justification: Allows users to quickly narrow options based on mood. Goal: Compare venues -> Method: Interactive Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Dropdown to change comparison metric (cost, closing time) -> Justification: Turns static table data into a dynamic decision-making tool. Goal: Detailed Info -> Method: Modal Pop-up (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Click "More Info" button -> Justification: Provides depth without navigating away, maintaining the SPA flow. Goal: Organize Text -> Method: Accordion (HTML/JS) -> Justification: Hides dense practical info until needed, reducing clutter. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
